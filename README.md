Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas
– Implemented a machine learning model using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict drug types based on patient attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. 
– Applied Label Encoding to preprocess categorical data and split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation. 
– Achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating effective classification of multiple drug categories. 
– Visualized the decision tree to interpret model decisions and understand key factors influencing drug prescriptions.
